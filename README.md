<h1>Python Dictionary Generator</h1>
This is a simple, easy to use, lightweight dictionary generator that requests a filename, baseword, and set of values to create a hybrid dictionary for bruteforcing.
<br />
<h3><i>Notes about the generator...</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>The file extension is automatically set to .txt
<li>The program automatically adds 1 to the maximum value so that it will be included in the range command
<li>The program generates the dictionary with hybrid versions of the baseword as well. These versions replace certain letters with the number often used in place of them, such as "I" with "1", "E" with "3", and "A" with "4"
</ul>
